## [Crossing a Line](https://snyder.substack.com/p/crossing-a-line) (Feb 19, 2025)

TS states an interesting opinion...

In a similar way that a Ukrainian train line approaches the line in the Zaporizhzhia Region, America is also approaching Russia in it's own way. While the train approach physically, nearing physical, and probably mortal, danger, America's approach is figurative... America is approach a Russian-like societal and governing state.

How?

1. Local media & news has died. Their place taken by a few commercial operations.
2. Media is owner by oligarchs whoa re close to government, or submit to it.
3. The daily lives of American Citizens are flooded with lies. Each of them contrary, leaving people confused on what to do, and how to feel.
4. Both countries have a president supported by oligarchs & their media power is trying to humiliate other branches of government
5. Both countries have executives seeking to marginalize legislation by ruling without passing laws, and ignoring court rulings to impose their own will.

They worst part is that American's aren't even aware of the similarities.

Perhaps what is most alarming is that its been happening for a very long time, and still Americans' are ignorant.

## [The Week Strong Man](https://snyder.substack.com/p/the-weak-strongman) (Feb 20, 2025)

Trump is a weak strongman — someone who’s power stems from making the others immediately around him weaker, thus making his relatively stronger in close proximity.

They stated that by doing so, and doing so to American institutions, he’s actually making the country net weaker… he’s not moving it forward.

He’s actually taking away his own ability to stop the Russia & Ukraine war… he has not made any policy moves, but only verbal statements — he’s mentioned sanctions but that would require and well staffed & resourced treasury for other countries to fear… unfortunately other countries think of it as a corrupt system for billionaires to exploit (as represented by the American media)

His other option is to stop providing weapons to Ukraine, which essentially forgoes his influence over how the war is conducted.

However, there's a counter argument to that above:

> He understands that the true power of the American economy is the dollar, if the dollar lose its power then USA could lose it hegemony… it will never be to a point that they become weak but they could no longer be the world power if the dollar loses its value as a trade currency.

You could say Trump is doing what is good for the USA, his style is not that appealing but it will be effective. His problem is that the true positive effects can be perceived in 5 to 10 years but if the republicans does not win the next election, the democrats will reverse many of his decisions so at that point in time USA may lose everything done in these days.

## [Kash Patel's Plot](https://snyder.substack.com/p/kash-patels-plots) (Feb 23, 2025)

> Law enforcement, in the traditional sense, depends upon the embrace of facts. There are laws; there are actions; as a factual matter, what you do might or might not violate the law. There are investigations, procedures, hearings, trials, and ultimately a notion of the rights of the citizen or the person. But history reminds us that agencies associated with law enforcement can also operate another way, as the instruments of purges.

> There are two preconditions for this. Their directors must see their jobs as to serve a leader rather than the law. And there must be animating fantasies, big lies, that enable prosecution. And then everyone can be guilty. Truth no longer protects anyone. Fantasy endangers everyone. If you do not believe in the non-existent conspiracy, you must be part of it. And if you do not believe in the untrue pronouncements of the ruler, you must be against him.
